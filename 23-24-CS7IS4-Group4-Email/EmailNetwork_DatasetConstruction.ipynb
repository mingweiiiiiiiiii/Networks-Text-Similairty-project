We \\nare looking for additional offices within which to conduct interviews this \\nSaturday, November 4th.  We are bringing in over 80 candidates and are in \\nneed of interview rooms.  Many of Enron\\'s Executives and VPs recognize the \\nimportance of the success of this event and have lent their offices to us for \\nthese interviews.  However, many more offices are needed.  The interview \\nprocess begins at approximately 9:00 a.m. and will conclude by 1:00 p.m. that \\nSaturday.  If you are concerned about the sensitive nature of some of the \\nmaterials in your office, we ask that you simply move the confidential \\ndocuments to one side of your desk and/or credenza.  We will see that the \\nmaterials are turned \"face down\" or covered with a blank piece of paper so as \\nnot to disturb their original state.  Unlike previous years, the Enron \\ninterviewers will be in the designated offices at all times with the \\ncandidates.   All offices will be locked after the completed interview \\nprocess.  Please let me know the availability of your office for interviews \\nat your earliest convenience.    We encourage your participation and \\nappreciate your support.  \\n\\n',\n",

This \\ncan be optional, as I know that jet lag my get the best of some.  \\n\\nThe morning on Monday will set the stage:  why we have gathered, endorsement \\nof our efforts (Causey).  Perhaps you, Brent and I could each give a short \\n\"state of the union of operations\" according to us - covering ENA, EGM and \\nEEL).  Then definition of the operating standards that we must uphold, \\ndiscussion, plans on reporting and buy in on these.  \\n\\nMonday lunch will allow everyone to share with their tablemates a project in \\nwhich they are involved that will have an impact on global consistency of \\noperational controls, or a project which through sharing or expanding could \\nhave such an impact.  Each table can report back as we gather to start the \\nafternoon.  \\n\\nHaving defined and discussed fundamental operating standards, we will move \\nMonday afternoon to review of the Doorstep concept: what, why, how and \\nlessons learned.  Then we will discuss next steps around this on-going \\nproject.  \\n\\nJust before the afternoon break, we will roll out a new communications tool \\nfor the operations controllers:  a website tailored for the group.  \\n\\nWe will finish the afternoon by tying in operations performance and its \\nimpact on assessing and measuring market risk and credit risk, with Ted \\nMurphy and Bill Bradford addressing the group.  \\n\\nMonday evening will include a tour of Enron Field and dinner at Ruggles \\nCenter Field Terrace.  Bill Bradford will join us for dinner, and we are \\nwaiting for an RSVP from Ted Murphy.  \\n\\nTuesday morning will start with Jeff Skilling as our real keynote speaker.  \\nHe plans to spend an hour plus with the group.  He will make an informal \\npresentation and then will entertain questions.  The rest of the morning will \\nbe spent in breakout teams, with assignments to come up with specific action \\nsteps to strengthen operating controls, improve the accuracy of information \\nprovided and move toward best practices in providing mid and back office \\nservices within Enron.  \\n\\nBefore lunch, Tom Gros and I will share a short story on CommodityLogic.  \\nPhilippe Bibi will join us for lunch to share his IT vision with the group.  \\nAfter lunch, we will wrap up and summarize next steps, including a date to \\nreconvene much of this group perhaps early in 2001 to check progess against \\nour designated next steps (wholesale group in London perhaps).  \\n\\nPlease call me or e:mail any comments or suggestions.

I will try \\nto have Patti connect me with you during my commute on Tuesday morning.  I \\nstart with a 7:30 meeting (Houston time), so I should be in my car from 6:30 \\nto about 7:15. \\n\\nI let Nikki know about a rescheduled date from Rick's PRC last week.  I don't \\nthink that there had been any widespread communication about the new date of \\nJune 27.  Will you still plan to come to Houston next week?  I have scheduled \\ndinner for us on Wednesday evening, assuming that you will still make the \\ntrip.  Just let me know.  Will you also be back for the meeting on June 27?  \\n\\nBefore you left for vacation I had tried to reach you regarding the MG \\nacquisition.  That should make life fun for you!  I wanted to talk about \\nresources and how I might be able to help in both the further due diligence \\nefforts and longer term in the assimilation.  As in my voice mail, I believe \\nthat a doorstep review of trading locations would be critical, both from a \\ncontrols perspective and from the perspective of an up close view of how they \\nrun their business.  It seems that might help jump start the plans around how \\nbest to assimilate the business.  I had suggested my new hire, Shona Wilson, \\nas a potential resource and then there are several of us who have already \\nbeen involved in doorstep reviews that could be involved both in the US and \\nin other locations.  Brent has forwarded a memo to me from Naomi Connell  who \\nseems to be formulating a plan for the doorstep reviews.   I don't know the \\nnames that she mentions (other than Tani Nath), and I am sure that she is \\nunaware of additional resources from Houston that could be used.  We can \\nhopefully talk about that tomorrow morning.    \",\n",

My commitment to Rick Causey is that I will have \\nthat global report in production by the end of the year.  There is much work \\nto do in defining the content and regularity of the report and even more work \\nto do to identify reliable sources of data for compiling the report.

I reviewed as many of the resumes as I could on the plane on the way \\nback to Houston today (all of the liberal arts resumes and about one third of \\nthe business resumes) and Brent reviewed them last night after his training \\nclass.

The plan of passing them from one person to another is not \\npractical,  and I should not have had to make the copies for Brent.  If you \\nare going to ask VP's and MD's to help in this process in a very short time \\nframe, then I would suggest that you use their time wisely.  If someone from \\nyou team had organized the resumes into three groups by GPA's or majors, that \\nwould have given us a good starting point, instead of a jumble of resumes.  \\nTwo page resumes were not stapled together and there were a number of resumes \\nof MBA's included, which should be considered for Associates interviews, not \\nAnalysts interviews.

It will be flexible and powerful enough to support managers at\\nall levels and in all industries. This project is supported directly by the\\nHR Desktop Manager group and has been endorsed by top managers throughout\\nSAP in the U.S. and Germany.\\n\\nSAP has learned that to produce great software products we have to get close\\nto our end users. To do that, we need your help. Our goal is to visit eight\\nSAP customers in the U.S. Enron is one of the eight companies we would like\\nto visit.\\n\\nWho do we want to interview and observe?\\nIn a one-day visit, we want to observe and interview three types of\\nmanagers.\\n* High-level manager, involved in strategic planning, overall budget\\nresponsibilities, strategic direction. The high-level manager tends to\\ndelegate most of his daily and weekly activities to subordinates.\\n* Operational manager, involved in running a large department or small\\nsubsidiary. Often reports to the high-level manager. Has budget and\\npersonnel responsibility for the department or subsidiary. May also have\\nproduct-planning responsibilities.\\n* Group manager, primarily focused on a business activity such as\\naccounts payable manager, line manager, or production planner; but also\\ninvolved in managing a small group. Often has hands-on personnel and\\nlower-level budget responsibilities. Concerned with the day-to-day business.\\n\\nWhat can you expect during a site visit?\\nWe have found that the most efficient way to organize our interviews is to\\nmeet with a contact person in your company (that would be me) who will then \\nescort us to our\\ninterviews. This allows our team to introduce themselves and explain their\\nobjectives.  Our interviews are conducted at the managers' workstations\\nwhere our team will spend about 1/2 hour observing the manager in his/her\\ndaily work and asking questions.  We will then spend the next hour with \\nhis/her\\nadministrative assistant.\\n\\nInterviewees do not have to prepare anything. We prefer to interview people\\nwhere they work because often the work environment can give us a lot of\\ninsights about what managers need from a software product. We ask people to\\nbe completely honest and forthcoming with us. We treat all sensitive\\ninformation with utmost confidentiality.\\n\\nThere will be two teams from SAP meeting with a total of 6 managers and \\nadministrative assistants from \\nvarious areas in various business units.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\",\n",

We'll see in a few days if \\nthis helped on contributions.  \\n\\nText of e:mail message to Energy Operations employees:\\n\\nTwo weeks ago I toured the Depelchin Center, one of the organizations that \\nreceives much of its funding from the United Way.  I was surprised to find \\nout about the many programs that the center offers to neglected and abused  \\nHouston children and  the caring adults who will open their homes as foster \\nparents.  I had already completed my electronic pledge card before going to \\nthe center.  Learning about the important programs offered through Depelchin \\nand meeting four year-old Jessica and ten year-old Steven who were \\ntemporarily housed there before going to foster homes made me very glad to \\nhave made that pledge.  \\n\\nEnron has a terrific matching program that allows all employees to receive \\nmatching funds for dollars that you may choose to give to non-profit \\norganizations.  Hopefully, many of you take advantage of this to stretch your \\ncharitable giving during the year.  The United Way campaign is the one time \\neach year that Enron invites employees to partner with the company to make a \\ndifference in the lives of so many in Houston.  Each dollar pledged by an \\nemployee is matched by Enron.  \\n\\nIf you have not yet completed your electronic pledge, please consider doing \\nso as soon as possible.  Our United Way campaign draws to its conclusion next \\nWednesday, August 23.  I hope that each one of you will consider making a \\npledge.  There is no gift that is too small, because cumulatively all Enron \\nemployees can make a significant positive impact for Houston.  Log on to \\nhttp://unitedway.enron.com to complete your pledge card.\\n\\nThanks to the many of you who have already completed your electronic \\npledge.    \",\n",

I assume that you have talked with both Mary \\nSolmonson and James Scribner about this process to understand the details.  \\nThey are the logical experts for that discussion.  Your memo is a little \\nvague on that, so if you are getting information from someone else and have \\nnot taken the time to talk with the best sources, I would suggest spending \\ntime with James and Mary so that you and they are appropriately informed.  \\n\\nAbsolutely there are procedures in place to handle these updates to GCP.  I \\nbelieve that these are pretty manual, as there are no systematic feeds from \\nEntelligence into GCP.  James and Mary (I refer to both because James has \\nonly recently assumed Mary\\'s duties within Global Databases) can best discuss \\nhow this process works.  If you are aware of specific concerns around this, I \\nknow that James and Mary will want to hear that from you.

There are definitely some challenges we have to \\novercome to make the Hub idea within CommodityLogic.com as successful as \\nEnronOnLine rather than have it turn out like Sitara.\\n\\nI won\\'t repeat thoughts about how we split CL from Enron, but let\\'s put \\nourselves in the shoes of somebody external for whom this was presented as a \\npotential solution. Well, that\\'s an easy decision, somebody else is doing the \\nhard work, and not charging us very much for it. So sign-up, but don\\'t rely \\non anything until we see everything working.\\n\\nHandling counterparties not using the system\\nThe challenge here is that the Final Solution World with overybody using the \\nHub is wonderful, but until everybody is using the Hub, we have to keep other \\nprocedures and systems going, which stretches resources, Development, IT \\nSupport and user. This was why we decided to delay getting Bolero - the \\nconcept is wonderful, but the value to any user is very dependent on everyone \\nelse one trades with using the system. This is classic Chicken and Egg. Tom \\nhas a vision of CL providing the staff to handle this. This is taking us \\ncloser to an outsource-to-Andersen-consulting model which is certainly \\nachievable, although not quite such an easy sell.\\n\\nHow much resource is left\\nThe latest project always tends to attract the most imaginative people, who \\nare therefore not available for keeping everything else going and moving \\nonwards. How about if we accept that such resource is dedicated to CL, and \\nthen review what is left in the remaining environment. Does it mean we hold \\noff doing anything? If we do then increasing volume means that we might end \\nup incurring costs for massive numbers of people! We should go through \\ncosting for \"What happens if we completely stop development of X project?\". \\nIf that shows one would need 200 clerks for 3 years until something else \\ncomes along then it may be cheaper than developing, but I hope in most cases \\nit is not!\\n\\nStart small to prove concept\\nE.g. first application in April 2001 only covers 20 fields\\nThis is excellent, and we needn\\'t shout it too loud to investors in CL, but \\nfor our internal back office costing we need to acknowledge that it will be \\nyears before we can switch off many internal systems.\\nWe might limit the payback period on projects not part of this strategy to 3 \\nyears out?\\n\\nInclude European aspects from the beginning\\nThis really isn\\'t very difficult so long as one has some long-on-common-sense \\nEuropeans (not just Brits) involved in both specification and development \\nfrom the beginning, but an as example of how not to do it, look at EnPower \\nwhich took a year to allow just for currencies etc!\\n\\n80-20 rule for types of transaction\\nEOL has shown the benefits of focussing on simpler products first.\\nOnce we have robust warehouses for collecting accounting (DTL) and risk \\n(RisktRAC?) numbers then we can think about having vanilla products on STP, \\nand yet-to-become-vanilla products on explicitly different, manual \\napproaches. Until that time, we have a strong desire to include as many \\ndifferent prodcuts as possible for a given commodity in one system, which \\nmakes separating vanillas from others more complicated and costly (Think of \\ncertain deals in Power99 which are approximations of the actual deals, and \\nmanually tweaked every so often)\\n\\nTesting\\nTom\\'s first thought is that we could leverage initial users (who would not \\npay) to do much of the testing.\\nEOL clearly got its testing done, but other experience shows that in order to \\nhave anything which saves time one really does need to do all the different \\nphases - component, system, integration, end-to-end, and then user-acceptance.\\nEOL saw confidentiality as an issue and was therefore unable to use many \\nexternal users early in the process. It did have massive \\nresource-commandability and so obtained input from many traders. Do the \\nSupport functions have sufficient slack that they will be able to provide the \\nsame sort of user attention? Given how often I hear \"short people\", that \\nstrikes me as something which in London would require significant additional \\nresource, even after MG is absorbed.\\n\\nWhat else did you come up with?\\nRichard\\n\\n\\n',\n",

While I know that they can't appreciate the \\nvast number of transactions that the group is currently handling, we still \\nneed to be able to deliver top notch service.  Unfortunately, we stub our toe \\nenough with Calgary that they view of our operation is one that delivers \\npretty poor to average service.  That is a terrible internal PR issue.  Let's \\nput our heads together on not just the confirm issue but all of our dealings \\nwith Calgary so that we quickly turn around our error rate (and/or their \\nperceptions) and  can sustain excellent service. I am copying Susan because \\nshe has dealt recently with an issue brought to our attention by  Rob \\nMilnthorp (president of Enron Canada).  She responded to Rob quickly and \\nhandled things professionally, so she may not have shared the details with \\nyou at the time.  But now we need to look at all of our outstanding, \\npotential or past issues with Calgary and get a solution in place.  She can \\nfill you in on the details in that situation.  \\n\\nSusan:  Do you have any ideas on how we can reshape our image with Calgary?  \\n\",\n",

Bill and I have been working \\nwith Sally Beck, Global Energy Ops and she will identify a  resource to help \\ninsure all internal controls (specific to  trading activities) are in place \\nin India.   As I understand the plan for coal, India will function mostly as \\nan origination unit  with the London office being responsible for supplying \\nthe coal.  Therefore, the net Enron position will probably be carried in the \\nLondon books.   However, risk books will still be required in India to \\ndetermine the net  MTM  for the 3rd party sales commitments in India.  These \\nbooks should include both the intercompany purchase from London  and the 3rd \\nparty sales.  The commercial group in India  will be responsible for local \\ncurves  (location (basis) specific - usually transportation costs), and \\nenergy operations (this will probably be you  initially until the trading \\nactivity has grown) will be responsible for the deal capture process \\n(including contract administration), a settlement process and risk management \\nadministration (daily valuation and reporting of risk books).   Accounting \\nwill be responsible for the reconciliation of risk books to the general \\nledger and financials.    There will also be a logistics process.   The \\nfollowing questions need to be addressed:  \\n\\n  With the increased  coal volumes will an increase in trading limits be \\nrequired?\\n      My understanding that the London coal group will be responsible for \\ndetermining this and working with Ted Murphy to change the \\n      policy, if necessary.   \\n  What trading activities will be performed in India vs. London?\\n      The answer to this is needed to determine the control infrastructure \\nrequired for the India office.    \\n\\nSally's employee starts on Monday,   I will let you know who she is and \\narrange a call.    You can rest assured, that although this may seen \\ncomplicated (and it is), Sally's Energy Ops team will be able to hold your \\nhand all the way through this process.    It will be critical that we \\ndemonstrate the control infrastructure is in place, before we can obtain \\nsigh-off for trading from Rick Buy. \\n\\nLooking forward to helping you get this ready for a July 1 start date. \\n\\n\\nThanks,\\nWanda Curry\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\nTo: Wanda Curry@ECT\\ncc: Bill Gathmann/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT \\nSubject: Enron Trading\\n\\nWanda,\\n\\nIt was nice talking to you on the conference call.

When \\nwe setup the Risk/Credit/Accnt/MIS/Internal Control function, I want to make \\nsure we do it RIGHT the FIRST time, keeping in mind that there is always room \\nfor improvement later.\\n\\nIn addition, I would like to discuss with you certain thought I have on the \\naccounting, budgeting,internal controls and internal audit areas in EIPL.

The pre-meetings are necessary \\ndue to the sheer size of the groups.  (In addition to the meetings detailed \\nin this schedule, Brent\\'s team in EGM is having pre-meetings as well.)  \\n\\nThe December 8th meeting will include all operations personnel from ENA, EGM \\nand EIM.  We will review the results from the pre-review meetings for Senior \\nSpecialists and below.  I have asked that the results from the pre-review \\nmeetings mirror the \"preferred distribution\", which as you probably know \\nsuggests that 15% of the population will not receive a bonus and should \\ntherefore be in the bottom two categories.  Assuming that appropriate work \\nhas been done at the pre-review meetings, this review on the 8th should not \\nbe too lengthy.  We will take considerably more time as we review the \\nmanagers, who will have been pre-ranked as well.  This will give us a good \\njumping off point for the cross calibration discussions.  We will then review \\nand rank the directors and senior directors.  We will also be discussing \\nsuggested promotions during this meeting as well.  Finally, assuming that I \\nstill have David Oxley and Wes Colwell captive and attentive, I will discuss \\nmy suggested rankings for the three VP\\'s who report to me.  (We will of \\ncourse pare down the list of attendees as we move up the ladder on levels \\nthat we are reviewing -- initial make up of the December 8th PRC is me and my \\ndirect reports within ENA, Brent and his direct reports within EGM and Brenda \\nHerod from EIM.)  I have also extended an invitation to Louise Kitchen to \\nattend the December 8th meeting.  I do not know yet if she will attend.  \\n\\nDo you have some suggestions for cross-calibrating on a global basis this \\nyear?  I think that next year we can put some plans in place early in the \\nyear to help facilitate this.  Would you like to attend the meeting here in \\nHouston on December 8th?

The purpose of my visit is in \\nregard to my Global Risk Management Operations role,   I believe that Rick \\nCausey met with you regarding some operations support that Brent and I will \\nprovide to Fernley during a transition period prior to the arrival and during \\nthe assimilation of Michael Jordan, the JP Morgan staffer that Fernley has \\nhired.  Brent and I will be working with Fernley next week to iron out the \\ndetails of our support for Fernley during that transition period.  We will \\nalso map out an Enron trading operations introduction  for Michael Jordan, \\nwhich may involve a short stint for him in Houston.  My goal is to provide a \\nstrong resource to Fernley during this transition period and to work with \\nFernley to provide whatever assistance, training, and orientation to Michael \\nin his role so that his assimilation can be as smooth and effective as \\npossible.  \\n\\nAnother purpose for the trip is to spend some time with Fernley and his  \\nbusiness controllers  to get their ideas on specific goals that as a group we \\nwould commit to for 2000.  I know that Barry and Richard Sage have many good \\nideas on how we can leverage knowledge and best practices across all Enron \\nlocations with trading operations.  My earlier trips to London this year were \\nfocused solely on Helsinki, and did not allow time to positively focus on \\nleveraging worldwide operations experience.  I value input from other trading \\noperations professionals and I look forward to the ideas that can be \\ngenerated in working with Barry, Richard and some of their direct reports.  \\n\\nI also contacted Tani Nath about my trip to see how I could support her as \\nshe moves into her role in Global Products.  I have not heard  from Tani, but \\nI understand from others that she will be in the Houston office next week.  \\nIt will be unfortunate to miss her on my trip, but based on my commitments in \\nHouston and Rick Causey's desire to move forward on providing trading \\noperations support to Fernley, next week is the best for me to be in London.  \\nI did meet with Tani for an hour when she was here week before last and \\noffered to help her in any way if she made the decision to accept the role \\nover Global Products.  I trust that she will contact me for that support as \\nneeded.  \\n\\nI have scheduled a short meeting one on one with you while I am there to \\ndiscuss how my global role can provide support and resources for your \\nbusiness efforts in London.  I look forward to meeting with you next week.  \\n\\nThis trip is not a leg of the worldwide operations/control review that we are \\nconducting at Joe Sutton's request.   By circumstance, as you know, we have \\ntaken a look at Helsinki and subsequently Oslo and Frankfurt.  There will be \\na similar review of Continental power, UK gas, UK power and global liquids.  \\nThe review teams are currently focused on operations/controls reviews of \\nNorth American locations and some entities in the US in which Enron has a \\nlarge ownership position.  It is likely that the continuation of this effort \\nin London will occur in mid April.  \\n\\nCopies of the drafts of the findings for Oslo and Frankfurt were provided to \\nFernley as soon as the team returned to Houston.  We hope to finalise those \\ndrafts this week as we receive comments from Fernley and the business \\nmanagers in Oslo and Frankfurt to whom those drafts were provided.  Fernley \\nsuggested that you would like to see the drafts as opposed to the final \\ncopies, so I will have those forwarded to you today.  The Sydney and \\nSingapore trip was a lengthy one, as it also involved a last leg of the trip \\nin London with regard to support for SIngapore.

I \\ncan also provide you with a draft of that report, the completion of which was \\npending input from Bill Bradford early this week (he made the trip but was \\nout of the office last week).

SInce there are at least 2 \\nsbeck's here, have you thought about adopting use of your long name address \\nrather than the shorter version to help in further differentiating between \\nus?   That might help eliminate confusion going forward.  \",\n",

I can leave a voice mail for you at \\nyour Enron number.  Or if you prefer, I would be happy to call you if you \\nwill provide me with a number where you will be.  Cliff Baxter and several \\nkey commercial personnel have asked that I call them after we have completed \\nour testing of all systems that support each commodity and product that we \\ntrade in North America.  I will make these phone calls myself, and will \\nnaturally treat all phone numbers that I have been given as confidential.  \\nPlease let me know your preference for notification.  \\n\\n2)  Definition of a global focus for trading operations:  Attached is a draft \\nmemo that Rick Causey proposes to send.  This memo describes a coordination \\nrole that I will play on certain operational policies and procedures that \\nshould be coordinated in all trading locations.  Please let me and/or Rick \\nknow if you have any comments or suggestions.  I had hoped to briefly discuss \\nthis with you in person, as I would want you to understand two points:  (1) \\nThis role will not prevent me from continuing a very strong focus on the \\nneeds of ENA.  I have worked very hard to assure a level of accuracy, control \\nand service in ENA operations.  Through that hard work, I believe that I have \\nyour confidence in my ability to deliver results.  I  would do nothing to \\njeopardize that.  (2)  There is a need for this coordination function, and \\nsome one will play that role.  If I play that role, I can be in the best \\nposition to influence outcomes with ENA\\'s needs in mind.    \\n\\n\\n\\n3)   Gas Logistics:  I will talk with Whalley about my thoughts on this, but \\nI had wanted to make you aware that Jeff Shankman believes that he wants \\nlogistics to report to him.  His stated reason to me is that he wants it to \\n\"look like power\".  I had wanted to discuss with you your thoughts on what  \\nthe criteria should be on which we make that decision.  I will propose to \\nGreg and Jeff that gas logistics should be located in direct proximity to the \\nregional traders in order to facilitate the flow of commercially viable \\ninformation about the pipes and capacity.  ( We have that now for the Central \\nand West desks, and should be able to make this happen as the 32nd floor is \\nbuilt out for gas.)  I believe, however, that gas logistics should now report \\nto Brent Price, my business controller over gas for the East, Central and \\nWest regions.  Brent would then have operations truly front to back (risk, \\nconfirmations, scheduling and invoicing) and he sits on 31 and works very \\nclosely with Jeff.   Also, Brent would be in the best position to ensure that \\nthe logistics team meets requirements for timeliness and accuracy of \\nvolumetric information so that we can achieve our target headcount reduction \\nin gas operations of 52 by year end 2000.  Without a continuing focus in \\nlogistics on the downstream information needs, I will be concerned about our \\nability to deliver our projected cost savings.  I also believe that Brent \\nwill be in the best position to ensure minimal flash to actual variances.  \\nWhile Greg and Jeff were certainly both with ECT in 1996 when we had an \\nearnings hit as a result of flash to actual variances, I am not sure that \\neither one was involved closely enough to appreciate the need for a strong \\nfront to back focus to prevent these problems, and that includes holding \\nlogistics accountable for their part in this.  \\n\\nI will let you know the outcome of my conversations with Greg and Jeff on \\nthis issue.

Do you want all of them to choose one of \\nthe floors noted in your e-mail message, or would it be better to schedule \\none or two floor meetings in locations that more easily incorporate this \\nsegment of Net Works?  I have noted below the approximate number of employees \\nper floor (including only those floors with a significant number of \\noperations employees):  \\n\\n  29th Floor (trading) 67 employees  EGM risk, vol. mgmt., confirms, \\nsettlements and EIM risk \\n\\n  30th Floor (trading) 35 employees  EGM risk, confirms, settlements (various \\nproducts) \\n\\n  31st Floor (trading) 52  employees  Power risk, confirms, vol. mgnt., \\nsettlements and DPR           and MPR teams\\n  \\n  32nd Floor (trading) 117 employees  Gas risk, logistics (all regions), \\noperational analysis\\n\\n     \\n  37th Floor   148 employees  Gas vol. mgmt., settlements, and global \\nservices       \\nAlso, given the fact that operations is a relative \"newcomer\" to Enron \\nNetworks and yet represents a large number of employees in the group, I would \\nbe happy to work with you on remarks for all of the floor meetings to make it \\neasier for you to be fully inclusive in these sessions.   --Sally \\n',\n",

       "  'Rahil will have a draft to me this afternoon, then he, Beth Apollo and I will \\nmeet tomorrow morning at 8:30 to discuss and revise.  I don\\'t want to \"mass \\nmail\" this on Friday.  (None of these guys will read it on Friday afternoon \\nor over the weekend anyway.)  Instead, I want to meet with Frank Vickers and \\nEd Baughman (I have known both for years and we get both gas and power \\ncovered) either Friday afternoon or Monday to go over the presentation in \\nperson and get their thoughts and input (Rahil included).  They will likely \\ncome up with questions that we have not thought of or where our presentation \\ncould be tweaked.  With revisions from this session, then it makes sense to \\nset up one on one meetings with each orgination team (we spread the word to \\nthe whole team, rather than just hitting the origination lead).  We can start \\nthose next week and finish most next week.  I think that the logistics of any \\noffsite would be difficult with schedules and I don\\'t really think that we \\nneed one.    \\n\\nCalgary will need a special message, and we may have to go to Calgary to \\ndeliver it.  You and I can discuss that in more detail.   Max will be in from \\nMexico on April 20, and Beth Apollo has already booked some time with him on \\nthat day for us to cover this information.  Laura Luce is here today and will \\nbe back in Houston next Wednesday, April 11.  I have booked time with her \\nthat afternoon to cover the presentation.  That will leave Portland as the \\nother \"out of towner\" to schedule.  I am planning a trip there the next time \\nthat Stacey White heads up there.  Right now we are looking at April 17, 18 \\nor 19.  We can send Chris info before that and plan to meet with him perhaps \\nin conjunction with that trip that I need to make around our west power risk \\nteam.  I would  welcome your participation in any of the meetings here in \\nHouston or on the trips that we will need to make.  You and I can discuss the \\nappropriate make-up of the team for each of these presentations at lunch \\ntomorrow.  \\n\\nI think that this plan will be effective and will give us the best coverage \\nand input.

Can we delay until then?  We do have a monthly fee of $16,000 that we \\nare receiving from Bridgeline that, while small, you could include in our \\nrevenue line to date.  I am not sure why it is not showing up as income.  \\nProbably because we have been considered a cost center to date.  I suspect \\nthat the income is simply being recorded as an offset to one of our cost \\ncenters.  By copy of this memo to Brian Heinrich, could you and he figure out \\nwhere that income is and classify it appropriately so that it shows as \\nrevenue?  Since our costs are fully allocated to business units, this should \\nbe pure margin.  Hey, you have to start somewhere!  \\n\\nI have a lunch meeting scheduled with Greg Piper on Friday this week. One of \\nthe items that I want to discuss with him is how we want to treat expenses \\nthat we are incurring while researching the feasibility of this business.  I \\ndon't have an answer for you today on what if any costs will not be allocated \\nto the business units.

For Energy Operations, that is usually very easy \\nsince there has been no revenues, and all of the costs are allocated out, so \\nthere should be zero EBIT if nothing changed.  Given your present direction, \\nhowever, you may be generating some margin in 2001.  Do you have a feel for \\nan amount I can put into our analysis and will 100% of your costs continue to \\nbe billed out or will some be applied to this new activity? I am hoping to \\nput something together next week, so if you or a designate could let me know \\nin a few days I would appreciate it. \\n\\nKerry Roper (x5-4895)\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  \"In a recent CommodityLogic staff meeting, I took stock of the number of \\npeople and projects that I have provided from Energy Operations to that \\nteam.  From conversations that you and I have had, I get the impression that \\nperhaps others have led you to believe that my commitment to CommodityLogic \\nhas been limited.  The truth is that I hand picked key members of the team \\nand transferred projects that we were already undertaking in Energy \\nOperations to round out the suite of products to be offered through \\nCommodityLogic.  I just thought that it might be helpful for you to have the \\nfacts so that you are fully informed whenever you are involved in \\nconversations around CommodityLogic. \\n\\nStaffing Contributions\\n CommodityLogic Project Manager (NomLogic):  Carrie Slagle, Manager\\n CommodityLogic Project Maanger (Integration):  Susan Harrison, Manager\\n CommodityLogic Project Manager (ContactLogic)  Mary Solmonson, Senior \\nDirector\\n CommodityLogic Team Member (NomLogic):  Molly Sumrow, Specialist\\n\\n User Requirement and Testing Staff:  Energy Operations Gas Schedulers, Power \\nConfirmation Team and   Financial Settlements \\n\\nProjects Transferred to CommodityLogic\\n\\n NomLogic (previously known as Contract Exchange in Energy Operations)\\n ContactLogic (global databases in Energy Operations) \\n\\n\\nTwo of the Project Managers on the team, Carrie Slagle and Susan Harrison, \\nwere transferred from Energy Operations to CommodityLogic.  Both had worked \\nin managerial roles in our natural gas business, reporting to Brent Price.  \\nBoth had been significantly challenged in the first half of 2000 by roles \\nwhere they were charged with managing large teams of people.  But knowing \\nboth Carrie and Susan well, I viewed them as valuable members of the \\noperations team who know a lot about the business.  Both have proven in the \\npast to be good project leaders. Therefore, identifying them as project \\nmanagers for CommodityLogic made a lot of sense -- providing gas operations \\nexperience to the CommodityLogic effort and utilizing their skills most \\nappropriately .  Brent Price and I worked together to sell Susan and Carrie \\non the assignment and to transition them to their CommodityLogic roles very \\nquickly.  \\n\\nOne of the key team members working under Carrie Slagle on NomLogic was a \\nscheduler on our gas team (Molly).  Bob Hall, our opeartions controller over \\nnatural gas, suggested that a scheduler on the team would be valuable, since \\nCarrie and Susan have actually never scheduled gas themselves.  NomLogic was \\nalready a project that was underway in Energy Operations.  We started the \\nproject shortly after the tremendous ramp up in natural gas volumes due to \\nEOL transactions.  We called the project Contract Exchange, and Bob Superty, \\nwho is the daily manager over gas logistics, was the project sponsor.  Tom \\nlooped in our Contract Exchange project into CommodityLogic and subsequently \\nrenamed it NomLogic.  Molly had been a member of the Contract Exchange \\nproject team, and we transfered her along with the project to \\nCommodityLogic.  \\n\\nMany of my key employees in gas scheduling, confirmations and settlements \\nwork very closely with the various CommodityLogic project managers.  It is \\ninput from my group that has created the modules by defining user \\nrequirements and they have served as the testing teams as well.   \\n\\nIn the fall, I assigned Mary Solmonson to focus full time on CommodityLogic.  \\nI recognized that we needed more senior level involvement and I viewed Mary's \\nparticipation as a good way to leverage my time.  Previously, she was a \\nsenior director managing our Global Databases group.  With an IT development \\nbackground and a very thorough knowledge of our operations business, Mary was \\nthe perfect candidate out of my direct report team to focus on \\nCommodityLogic.  Unfortunately, her recent health problems will curtail her \\ninvolvement going forward.  During the five months that she was assigned to \\nCommodityLogic, Mary developed a plan for ContactLogic that Tom feels is \\nexcellent and notes that it is an important complement to the other modules.  \\n\\nEarly in the project, I had also selected two very key and knowledgeable \\noperations professionals to be part of the  CommodityLogic team - Leslie \\nReeves, who played a significant role in building Enron's power business from \\nday one, and Todd Hall, with experience in natural gas and emerging \\nproducts.  They were part of the  CommodityLogic team in the early days, and \\nboth made personal decisions to exit the team and return to managing mid and \\nback office operations.   Susan Harrison and Carrie Slagle were their \\nreplacements on CommodityLogic.    \\n\",\n",

Thought I would do \\na quick note to bring you up to date on some things. \\n\\nCommercialization Efforts- Services:  Delayed by several days due to the \\nunexpected absence of Mary Solmonson for health reasons.  I learned about \\nthis when I returned to the office on Tuesday, and have worked to replace her \\nas best we can during this market sizing phase.  Jennifer Denney (who was in \\nDallas with us and works under Sheri Thomas in the EOL Product Control Group) \\nwill partner with James Scribner in Mary's absence to help us run down \\nadditional data on potential customers.  Beth Apollo will be working closely \\nwith James and Jennifer.  They will welcome Rahil's help and will continue to \\nwork with Jennifer on developing the revenue model.  \\n\\nCommercialization Efforts - Consulting:  Bjorn Hagelman in the RAC group made \\na presentation at the Risk Forum luncheon last week outlining a plan for \\nproviding risk consulting services to external customers.  Some of his ideas \\noverlap the ideas around consulting that we fleshed out in our Dallas \\nmeeting.  Some of his ideas included providing services from my risk \\noperations team.  I want this to be a concerted and not disjointed effort.  \\nBjorn's vision is to create an Enron sub that will be the consulting \\ncompany.  Our team in Dallas saw wisdom in partnering with an \\naccounting/consulting firm - established marketing arm, existing customer \\ncontacts, proven consulting skills, depth of resources, etc.  There could be \\na play to get a hefty sum up front from a consulting firm to partner with us \\n- we impart our risk knowledge, they get the edge in the marketplace from \\npairing with us, we take our upfront payment, they do most of the grinding \\nwork - not necessarily a bad model.  Bjorn seems to be in a hurry, as he has \\nidentified a shipping company in Europe that is in need of risk consulting \\nand is ready to pay.  Probably okay for him to start this effort in that \\nway.  Prove concept, and then we can consider the wisdom of partnering with \\nsomeone else.  I spent some time with him today.  I want to be sure that he \\ndoesn't commit my team to provide a service without our understanding and \\nbeing in agreement with the fee structure.  We are okay for right now.  I \\nwill be following what Bjorn is doing and looking for ways to work together \\nif there is a good upside.  I will keep you posted.  \\n\\nCommercialization Efforts - Internal Marketing:  We have to change some \\nbusiness practices within Enron and create a mind shift when originators are \\nselling operational services to their customers.  We must price those and we \\nmust have a mechanism for granting the appropriate income to Operations.  \\nDeal is in the works through power origination team - they priced our \\nservices to customer without our involvement- pricing may not even be \\nsufficient to cover our costs.  We are researching.  To do's here are to \\ncreate an internal marketing document to review with lead originators and to \\nchange DASH process so that Operations has a sign-off.  I met with Louise \\ntoday on this.  I will plan meetings with origination teams during the week \\nof March 19.  Would love to get your input on our presentation to the orig \\nteams.  I will get you a draft for your comments. \\n\\nOperational Risk:  Key focus this week has been on rebuilding a risk team in \\nPortland.  Have worked with Stacey White (my power risk director) and Tim \\nBelden to make sure we have a short term and long term plan that will work.  \\nI am comfortable that we have devised a good plan.  (We lost the manager of \\nthat group last week - a planned move to London to follow her husband to an \\nEnron job there.  Our unexpected change this week was the resignation Monday \\nof another risk book administrator from Portland.) \\n\\nOperational Risk:  Another key area that we are focusing on is the HPL sale.  \\nEnd of day today we will know which employees are going to AEP.  We are \\nworking on a smooth transition plan and how we will handle trailing issues \\nwith customers after the sale effective date.  We expect to eliminate 46 \\npositions with the sale.  This number was much larger earlier in the year \\n(around 70), but have had a lot of attrition with the news of the sale.  Bob \\nHall is focused on the details around this issue.  \\n\\nOperational Risk:  We completed a Doorstep Review on the Monterrey office \\nlast week.  (This is the review of operational controls and procedures.)  \\nWent well - Max was skeptical about the process at first, but pleased in the \\nend.  I will forward and e:mail to you from Max proclaiming his support of \\nthese reviews.  We overhauled this week the Doorstep Review schedule for the \\nremainder of the year and reviewed that today with Rick Causey.  He likes the \\nrevisions that we have made.  Beth Apollo on my team is leading this effort.  \\n\\nSpring Break Plans:  My children are on Spring Break the week of March 12 and \\nthe nanny has the week off.  We will be out of town through Wednesday, March \\n13 with the whole family looking at colleges for Meagan.  Patti has contact \\nnumbers for me if needed.  I may decide to come back into the office on \\nThursday and Friday.  I will let Patti know when we get back in town.  I will \\neither see you the end of next week, or back on Monday, March 19.

       "  'Thanks for your comments on the standards.  Our approach in creating a global \\nexception reporting mechanism is to start simply and build from there.  Our \\ninitial cut is to have effective exception reporting on a handful of critical \\nstandards by the end of this year.  That will be a first, to on a daily basis \\nhave a view into the exceptions outside the global  standards.  Many of the \\nmeasurements that you mention are great management tools for accessing the \\nlevel of excellence of the services that we are delivering and the competence \\nof those that are managing these services.  Some of these may be more \\nappropriately contained in a monthly operations report that I have instituted \\nwithin ENA and which we are working to proliferate across all of the \\nwholesale merchant services companies.  Give me a call and we can set a time \\nto get together for a few minutes and I can review this operating report with \\nyou.  \\n\\nWe spent some time at our offsite in late October with all operations \\ncontrollers reviewing and discussing these standards.  Shona has taken a stab \\nat the format of these exception reports.  It is likely that we will have a \\nrep from each of the operating companies participate in the final design of \\nthese reports, so that all feel as if they own the intended output from these \\nreports.  \\n\\nYes, we are gleaning this information from those that are responsible for \\nthese activities.  My purpose is not to use this info to punish or prosecute, \\nbut instead to use this exception report as a tool to garner resources as \\nneeded to clear the exceptions.  It is invariably the deals that are \\nexceptions in some way that create the problems.  For instance, small power \\ndeals that were done in Calgary before they had a power book set up.  These \\nwere \"on the side\" and not captured in total power exposure because they \\ndidn\\'t have a book to put them in (a discovery during the doorstep review).  \\nIf this goes on the exception report, then we can highjack someone in risk in \\nHouston to help Calgary set up a new book, or get IT resources focused \\nquickly on any solution that may require their input to fix.  By having a \\nprescribed elevation of these exceptions, we should get the appropriate \\nattention to correct them.  The spur for making sure that all exceptions are \\nappropriately noted, will be that if there is a problem with any deal that \\nwas an exception (not in the books, no confirm, etc.) and was not included on \\nthe exception report, that this will be grounds for termination for the \\nappropriate operations controller.  I will make sure that as we start this \\nreporting process that this is well understood.

I think the diagnostic measure \\nshould be, for each commodity DPR a report daily of all those signed off as \\nfinal (note I do not neccessarily mean \"officialized\") after the relevant \\nmarket opening time (usuaully 7.30 am)\\n\\nTimely confirmation and execution of transactions (completeness, accuracy, \\nexistence)\\n\\nMonthly report of all unmatched confirmations:\\n\\n- outstanding inward confirmations (i.e. sent out, not signed) \\n- outstanding outward confirmations (i.e deal done, confirm not sent) \\n- outstanding mismatched or disputed confirmations\\n\\nshowing deal trade date, start date, commodity, counterparty, MTM value, aged\\n\\nSettlements with counterparties occurs accurately and timely (non CACS, non \\nDashed deals)\\n\\nMonthly report of cumulative amounts of all unmatched or unapplied cash:\\n\\nUnapplied cash by counterparty, in original denomination, including deal \\nreference if any\\nUnmatched amounts by deal, where settled amount differs from maturing forward \\nMTM value\\n\\nOne additional thing that ocurred to me was the fact that those responsible \\nfor supplying the information are also those responsible for the operation \\nunderlying it in some sense, so the obvious pitfalls of self - assessment \\nwill come into play here.

       "  'Doorstep reviews are by design a quick look at commercial activities and the \\nmid and back office support for those activities in our wholesale \\nbusinesses.   (EBS and EES will be included in 2001.)  The controls around \\nmid and back office activities are best understood by conducting a deal test \\n- i.e. following the process and documentation around a series of \\ntransactions from the inception of a deal through the collection of cash.  \\nAsking someone to explain their processes and controls is more the act of \\nexplaining what we think happens.  Doing a deal test tells us what does \\nhappen.  And it is when there are differences between the controls that we \\nbelieve to be in place and what actually happens, that we identify where \\noperational, and perhaps financial, risk is created. \\n\\nThese reviews are not designed to replace the internal audit work for which \\nEnron has contracted with Arthur Andersen.  As such, they are purposely \\ndesigned to be conducted in a shorter timeframe than AA\\'s reviews and to \\nproduce less paperwork.  It is both the quick assessment of control gaps and \\npotential operational risk, and the quick solutions to correct these, that \\nare valuable in these reviews.  These reviews also look  for ways to leverage \\nsuccess stories from one office to another in terms of best in class \\npractices or practical solutions to shared problems.  Briefly, the doorstep \\nreview process would follow this set of steps:\\n\\n 1)  Cross-functional doorstep review team arrives at subject office.  This \\nis usually unannounced, but key personnel in the subject office may be \\nnotified of the review a few days prior to the team\\'s arrival to be certain \\nthat key individuals in that office will be not be out of town. \\n\\n 2)  Doorstep team lead will meet with the head of the subject office to tell \\nthem about the parameters of the review and to ask their co-operation in \\nmaking information and personnel available to complete the review.  \\n\\n 3)  The review is conducted, including information sessions with key \\ncommercial personnel to understand the business conducted in the office and \\nkey control/operations personnel to understand the business processes.  The \\ndeal test is conducted on a relevant sample of deals to verify the process \\nand controls that were followed in the life of the transactions.  \\n\\n 4)  The doorstep team usually has a rough draft of key points by the end of \\nthe review, which includes both controls that are working well and those \\nwhich may not be working as designed.  Potential action items are suggested.  \\nThis information is reviewed with the head of the office, as they are usually \\nvery interested in knowing what can be done to improve controls to support \\ntheir business.   There are times when the head of an office will suggest an \\nadditional point to be added to the list of action items, knowing that with \\nthis focus he/she can get help in accomplishing certain efforts to support \\nthe growth of their business.  The doorstep team lets the head of the office \\nknow to whom this information will be communicated and the timing for doing \\nso. \\n\\n 5)  Starting late in 2000, the findings from doorstep reviews would next be \\nreviewed with Ted Murphy and me.  Ted\\'s viewpoint would be from Risk Controls \\nand mine from the mid and back office operations point of view.  Ted and I, \\nassisted by Cassandra Schultz and Shona Wilson, would work with appropriate \\npersonnel in the subject offices to understand who would assume \\nresponsibility for addressing action items noted from the doorstep review and \\nto determine the appropriate time period for completing these action items.  \\nThen on a quarterly basis, Ted and I would meet with Rick Buy and Rick Causey \\nto give them a recap of doorstep reviews completed during that quarter, \\ndoorstep findings that had been handled, updates on any outstanding doorstep \\nfindings and plans for the next quarter.  Through most of 2000, the doorstep \\nteams met with Rick and Rick within a few days of returning from each \\ndoorstep review.  This immediate feedback step was passed to Ted and me \\nsometime late in 2000.  We did agree that we would meet with Rick and Rick \\nbefore the quarterly review if certain doorstep findings were of particular \\nconcern or if we felt that they needed to be informed on an issue in a more \\ntimely manner than quarterly.   \\n\\nSteps 1 through 4 were followed in the review of the scrap metals business in \\nGermany.  Shona did conduct a debriefing session with the managing directors \\nin charge of the scrap metal business.  Her impression was that they were not \\nconcerned over the length of time that it was taking to implement the \\nintegration plan nor over the somewhat irregular payment methods that were \\ndiscovered during the deal test that are not in keeping with Enron\\'s \\npractices.  Shona also debriefed with Mike Jordan, and I believe that Fernley \\nwas involved in that session as well.  At my suggestion, she also contacted \\nJoe Gold to inform him of her findings.  I do not know what the timing was \\nfor Joe to get back to Shona, relative to Rick Buy\\'s e:mail message.  \\n\\nMichael, I understand that you may have felt blind-sided by the e:mail from \\nRick Buy on his concerns over the scrap metal business.  And if that was the \\ncase, I apologize for that.  While Shona did debrief with Mike and Fernley, I \\nknow that she did not review the teams findings directly with you.  If you \\nwould like to be included in a direct debriefing with the doorstep team when \\nthey review businesses that are managed by EEL, we can certainly add that as \\na clear step from this point going forward.   The out of the ordinary step in \\nthis doorstep review was Shona\\'s call to Rick Buy and Rick Causey to alert \\nthem to the doorstep team\\'s concerns over irregular payment methods and the \\nlevel of interest in controls that she perceived from the commercial managing \\ndirectors.   I attribute that to a miscommunication between Shona and \\nmyself.   Although we had changed the process at year end so that the \\ndownload after doorstep was to be with Ted and me, as Shona and I voice \\nmailed back and forth she thought that I had asked that she initiate a \\nmeeting with Rick and Rick.   This meeting should have been with Ted and me.  \\nIn leaving a voice mail for the two Rick\\'s about setting up a meeting, Shona \\nmentioned some concerns.  Rick Buy is the one that called her back and asked \\nfor more detail.  She definitely covered both the teams findings and the \\nintegration plan that was underway with Rick Buy.  We don\\'t, however, control \\nwhich points Rick chooses to focus on or those to which he chooses to react.  \\n\\nTo reiterate, the findings from these doorstep reviews are shared with the \\nheads of the subject offices at the close of the reviews.  The effort here is \\nto help identify control issues that could create risk to a business and to \\noffer solutions and resources that may be available from across the entire \\nEnron organization.  The key is quick discovery and quick resolution.   The \\nfindings create a dialogue between the business units, RAC and Operations, \\nwhich I believe is healthy.  We purposefully have chosen not to \\n\"over-wordsmith\" the findings or to delay discussing concerns that can be \\nsurfaced through these reviews.  Frankly, I believe that these reviews can \\nreveal things that are sometimes missed in AA\\'s reviews from a practical \\nperspective and afford us the opportunity to mitigate operational risk.  \\n\\nI would be glad to discuss any details of the doorstep review process with \\nyou.  We certainly want you to be informed and to view this process as \\nvaluable input for you in managing EEL\\'s business.  Mike Jordan and certain \\nmembers of his team will be involved with doorstep reviews for other \\nbusinesses outside EEL later in the year.  We are certainly open to any \\nsuggestions you may have on getting the most out of this process.',\n",

I have mentioned to you before, \\nHector, that an Enron friend has dealt with a brain tumor successfully.  That \\nis Barbara Gray, an attorney in ENA's Legal Department.  Barbara counsels \\npatients and their families who are facing situations similar to hers.  If \\nyou feel like you would like to talk with someone who can understand on a \\nmore firsthand basis what you and Brenda are facing, I would encourage you to \\ncontact Barbara.  In addition to having been through her own battle with a \\nbrain tumor, she is simply a wonderful person whom I know you would enjoy \\nmeeting.

Here are some of the things that I would like to do next week:\\n\\n review your action plan to move the close and officialization of London \\nbooks to same day, - certainly want to review this in detail with you - the \\nissue being that we may not in the short/medium term be able to change \\nsystems infrastructure to run same day - but with a combination of process \\nand tactical systems enhancements we may be able to deliver no action p&l, \\nnew activity p&l and position signoff on trade date with 'officialisation' of \\nbooks on T+1 in time for RAC VAR explain and limit monitoring process\\n\\nAlso I would like to go through our credit difficulties with you and Ted at \\nsame time - more for information on this  - because when we 'solve' market \\nrisk reporting issues we will face big push to 'clean' credit exposure \\nreporting process - Office of Chair is very insistent on this\\n\\n to replicate, if appropriate,  an Operational Risk information session for \\nLondon counterparts (you and I can  review early in the week what we are \\ndoing here in Houston today and modify the info for Europe) \\nWould defintely welcome this - I can walk through the European MO issues \\ntrying to identify key operational risk themes - top of my list is Metals\\n\\nI would like to spend some time on Metals with you - hence the lunch on \\nWednesday with Andy Cornfield and Howard Carter the two controllers for \\nMetals ( Brokerage and Merchanting ) - the starting place for this will be \\nthe presentation I gave to Rick Causey in early December.\\n\\n discuss the Doorstep process with you and, if you deem appropriate, your \\nbusiness controllers in the   London office who will participate in Doorstep \\nreviews this year (clear up and questions and get your input  on how to \\ncontinually improve the process), \\nWould like to brainstorm the linkage between control standards reporting, \\nself assessment of Op risk and doorstep - this can be done initially in a \\nsmall group but additionally I believe the business controllers would welcome \\nsome more background of why Rick,Rick and yourself need the process to be \\nsuccessful - I think they understand ( I have fully promoted it ) but your \\n'asides' explaining the weight Jeff assigns to it are very powerful motivators\\n\\n discuss with Mark Pickering the technology dependencies of the London office \\nrelated to speeding up   London's information for the corporate DPR\\nAs explained above - additionally I would like to walk you through the \\nimplementation of our change management structure which attempts to cross \\nprioritise all IT development efforts - a meeting with Steve Whitaker, Mark \\nand Fernley on this would be useful\\n\\n do some planning with you for the February 12 & 13 ASE - certainly in \\ncalendar and signed off by the executive committee of one ( my wife !!! )\\n\\n discuss the feasibility of utilizing our operational pricing model in London \\n - can you let me know some more of this - I am uncertain of it\\n\\n discuss your ideas and thoughts on CommodityLogic and other ideas around \\npotential commercialization of  mid and back office services - The below is a \\nsection of an objective I am asking my settlements director to follow - I \\nwould like to expand on these and other thoughts - particularly the absence \\nof vision/strategy documentation for CL\\n\\nLead on all CommodityLogic initiatives associated with Settlements ( note \\nthis is my definition of what CL should be doing ) including :-\\nChanging Market practices\\ncreate cashflow messaging within each transaction\\ncreate payment advice notification for each transaction at inception and \\nliquidation \\nre-evaluate operational cost structure associated with any possible changes \\nto terms of trade\\nModule/Application developments\\nSynergy from internal process changes ( pulling Settlements and Documentation \\ntogether )\\nelimination of paper/fax confirmation processes if we can utilise electronic \\nmessaging of cashflow details within transactions and electronic messaging of \\npayment advices at inception ( based upon planned trade settlement  ) and at \\nliquidation ( based upon actual trade settlement )\\n\\n \\nIn addition, I would like to meet with anyone in the London office that you \\nthink would be beneficial.

Many of Enron\\'s Executives and VPs recognize the \\nimportance of the success of this event and have lent their offices to us for \\nthese interviews.  However, many more offices are needed.  The interview \\nprocess begins at approximately 9:00 a.m. and will conclude by 1:00 p.m. that \\nSaturday.  If you are concerned about the sensitive nature of some of the \\nmaterials in your office, we ask that you simply move the confidential \\ndocuments to one side of your desk and/or credenza.  We will see that the \\nmaterials are turned \"face down\" or covered with a blank piece of paper so as \\nnot to disturb their original state.  Unlike previous years, the Enron \\ninterviewers will be in the designated offices at all times with the \\ncandidates.   All offices will be locked after the completed interview \\nprocess.  Please let me know the availability of your office for interviews \\nat your earliest convenience.    We encourage your participation and \\nappreciate your support.  \\n\\n',\n",

This \\ncan be optional, as I know that jet lag my get the best of some.  \\n\\nThe morning on Monday will set the stage:  why we have gathered, endorsement \\nof our efforts (Causey).  Perhaps you, Brent and I could each give a short \\n\"state of the union of operations\" according to us - covering ENA, EGM and \\nEEL).  Then definition of the operating standards that we must uphold, \\ndiscussion, plans on reporting and buy in on these.  \\n\\nMonday lunch will allow everyone to share with their tablemates a project in \\nwhich they are involved that will have an impact on global consistency of \\noperational controls, or a project which through sharing or expanding could \\nhave such an impact.  Each table can report back as we gather to start the \\nafternoon.  \\n\\nHaving defined and discussed fundamental operating standards, we will move \\nMonday afternoon to review of the Doorstep concept: what, why, how and \\nlessons learned.  Then we will discuss next steps around this on-going \\nproject.  \\n\\nJust before the afternoon break, we will roll out a new communications tool \\nfor the operations controllers:  a website tailored for the group.  \\n\\nWe will finish the afternoon by tying in operations performance and its \\nimpact on assessing and measuring market risk and credit risk, with Ted \\nMurphy and Bill Bradford addressing the group.  \\n\\nMonday evening will include a tour of Enron Field and dinner at Ruggles \\nCenter Field Terrace.  Bill Bradford will join us for dinner, and we are \\nwaiting for an RSVP from Ted Murphy.  \\n\\nTuesday morning will start with Jeff Skilling as our real keynote speaker.  \\nHe plans to spend an hour plus with the group.  He will make an informal \\npresentation and then will entertain questions.  The rest of the morning will \\nbe spent in breakout teams, with assignments to come up with specific action \\nsteps to strengthen operating controls, improve the accuracy of information \\nprovided and move toward best practices in providing mid and back office \\nservices within Enron.  \\n\\nBefore lunch, Tom Gros and I will share a short story on CommodityLogic.  \\nPhilippe Bibi will join us for lunch to share his IT vision with the group.  \\nAfter lunch, we will wrap up and summarize next steps, including a date to \\nreconvene much of this group perhaps early in 2001 to check progess against \\nour designated next steps (wholesale group in London perhaps).  \\n\\nPlease call me or e:mail any comments or suggestions.

I apologize that Lexi and=\\n=20\\nShelly were unable to provide you with the answers you were seeking.  I wis=\\nh=20\\nthat you had contacted either Celeste or me to indicate that you were havin=\\ng=20\\ndifficulty.  I have personally assured you on several occasions that I was=\\n=20\\navailable to either speak with you or meet with you if for some reason any=\\n=20\\nmember of my staff was not responsive.  That being said please allow me to=\\n=20\\nexplain the recruiting strategy since I was instrumental in helping to set =\\nit.\\n\\nYou are absolutely correct.  It is great to do market research if time=20\\npermits or it is regarding an issue of which we have little knowledge.  As=\\n=20\\nyou are aware, over the past year we have engaged a professional recruiting=\\n=20\\nfirm (Brecker & Merryman) who has assisted us in a number of different mark=\\net=20\\nresearch projects.  However, in my opinion, this issue is not one that=20\\nrequired much research.  I have been involved in recruiting in some way,=20\\nshape or form at both the graduate and undergraduate level for the past 10=\\n=20\\nyears.  Most major organizations, with the exception of the Accounting firm=\\ns,=20\\nbegin the summer intern recruiting process in early spring.  There are=20\\nactually some universities that do not allow recruitment of summer interns=\\n=20\\nuntil after a certain date, particularly in the MBA programs.  For example,=\\n=20\\nHarvard does not allow an organization to come on campus and speak to first=\\n=20\\nyear students until January.  As indicated, the firms that generally recrui=\\nt=20\\nin the fall are the Accounting firms and they are primarily recruiting for=\\n=20\\n\"spring\" internships.\\n\\nThe recruiting strategy at Enron is no different this year than it was last=\\n=20\\nyear with respect to summer interns.   Presentations were made in January &=\\n=20\\nFebruary and offers were made in February and March.  The only school that=\\n=20\\ndid not follow the normal process was OU under the direction of George Hope=\\n. =20\\nWe did, of course, recruit summer interns in the fall for the tax group=20\\nbecause they are competing directly with the Accounting Firms.\\n\\nUtilizing this strategy did not impair Enron=01,s ability to hire quality s=\\nummer=20\\ninterns.  This past summer Enron had 76 summer Analysts (undergraduate) and=\\n=20\\n40 summer Associates (graduate).  We intentionally limited the number of=20\\nsummer hires to ensure that the individuals hired received meaningful=20\\nassignments.  Approximately 85% of these individuals received permanent=20\\noffers to join Enron.  =20\\n\\nThe reason Enron has not had a problem recruiting quality undergraduate=20\\nsummer interns is primarily because many organizations do not hire=20\\nundergraduates for summer positions.  They generally focus on MBAs,=20\\nparticularly the investment banks and consulting firms which are the firms=\\n=20\\nthat Jeff Skilling identifies as Enron\\'s competitors.  Because the=20\\nundergraduates are not actively recruited by our competition we have=20\\ncontinued to have a special focus on these individuals (i.e. the reason the=\\nre=20\\nwere 76 undergraduates and only 40 MBAs).\\n\\nWith respect to OU and UT specifically since those were the schools about=\\n=20\\nwhich you raised a concern, let me address your concerns.  In your e-mail y=\\nou=20\\nindicated that you had research conducted at UT and OU.  You did not howeve=\\nr,=20\\nprovide the results of the research or the person to whom they had spoken=\\n=20\\ntherefore I had Lexi Elliott contact both UT and OU.\\n\\nWhile OU has not gotten back to her, following is the information obtained=\\n=20\\nfrom UT.\\n\\no The contact at UT Career Services is Cindy Henson. =20\\no According to Cindy, approximately 5% of companies actively recruiting on=\\n=20\\ncampus conduct interviews in the fall for \"summer\" internships.  Cindy=20\\nattributes  this to the fact that these companies cannot come in the spring=\\n,=20\\nor, in the case of Andersen Consulting, have a tremendous need and conduct=\\n=20\\nall interviews  at one time. =20\\no In conclusion, Cindy estimated that 95% of companies actively recruiting =\\non=20\\ncampus recruit in the spring for summer internships.\\n\\nWe have not received information from OU therefore I am unable to provide t=\\nhe=20\\nstatistics at this time.  I will provide as soon as I am in receipt of such=\\n=20\\ninformation. =20\\n\\nIt appears that the information your source obtained is considerably=20\\ndifferent than what we were told.  If you would provide the name of the=20\\nindividual to whom they spoke I will follow up to determine the reason for=\\n=20\\nthe discrepancies.\\n\\nWhile I understand your concern with respect to OU, they appear to be=20\\ndifferent than most of the other schools at which we recruit.  If you belie=\\nve=20\\nthat it is critical to recruit summer interns at OU in the fall we are=20\\nsupportive; however, because Lexi has other school interviews that are=20\\nalready scheduled she will not be in a position to facilitate the interview=\\n=20\\nprocess during the trip you have scheduled currently.  As you are aware, in=\\n=20\\nmost instances, the dates for presentations and interviews are dictated by=\\n=20\\nthe respective universities and were secured in early August. If you would=\\n=20\\nlike for her to try and secure an interview schedule for a later date this=\\n=20\\nfall she can certainly work with your schedule and her current schedule to=\\n=20\\nsupport your efforts.\\n\\nI hope this has been helpful.  I can understand and appreciate your=20\\nfrustration if you are not getting answers from the recruiter or her=20\\nmanager.  Again, I offer that I am available and willing to work with you i=\\nf=20\\nyou are having difficulty with members of the Program staff. =20\\n\\nPlease let me know what you decide about recruiting this fall for summer=20\\ninterns and whether I can be of any additional assistance.\\n\\nCharlene\\n\\n',\n",

       "  \"Sally,\\n\\nThanks for the email and update.  I agree that we must do something quickly \\nto resolve this.  I believe that you should interview for summer interns as \\nan extension to your upcoming planned recruiting trip.  I know you were very \\nhappy with the summer interns from the energy management program at OU that \\nyou got last year ( I was surprised and the school was thrilled  that you \\noffered all 5 permanent positions upon graduation).   We cant lose that \\nmomentum.  I am sure that each school's program is different and that most \\ndon't interview for summer interns this early in the year but from what I \\nhave learned about the OU schedule, we will lose all the top candidates if we \\nwait.  I am sure that is not what Charlene and Celeste were trying to \\naccomplish with their guidelines.\\n\\nPlease keep me up informed on this matter.\\n\\nThanks and good luck with the students.\\n\\nmike\\n\\n\\n   \\n\\tEnron North America Corp.\\n\\t\\n\\tFrom:  Sally Beck                           10/02/2000 07:13 PM\\n\\t\\n\\nTo: Charlene Jackson/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Celeste Roberts/HOU/ECT@ECT\\ncc: Richard Causey/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Mike McConnell/HOU/ECT@ECT \\nSubject: Hiring Practices for Summer Interns\\n\\n\\nWhile recruiting on campus recently I became aware that a decision was made \\nat the Program level to not interview this fall for 2001 summer interns.  In \\ntalking with students and faculty at The University of Texas and University \\nof Oklahoma, it became clear that there is concern over the feasibility of an \\ninternship with Enron, as other top firms will be recruiting this fall for \\nsummer 2001 interns.  I have communicated my concerns to Lexi Elliott and her \\nmanager, Shelley Jones, and was told by both that the decision to delay \\ninterviews for summer interns was made at a Program level based on Enron's \\nstaffing.  When I asked about the competitive data available regarding the \\npractice of other firms on summer intern interviews, I was even more \\nconcerned to discover that neither Lexi nor Shelley had that data.  It would \\nseem critical to know what the competition is doing in terms of summer intern \\ninterview schedules in order to understand the risk that could be created for \\nEnron by not interviewing this fall for these important feeder positions for \\nour Analyst and Associates programs.  \\n\\nI have had conversations over the last two weeks with Lexi and Shelley, with \\nno resolution.  When they could not provide the competitive data to either \\nconfirm or eliminate my concerns, I volunteered to have James Scribner, a  \\nSenior Director on my team, obtain this market information.  Lexi and Shelley \\neither did not have the time to gather this data, or were not sure how to do \\nso.  They were pleased to have some help in getting our hands on this \\ncritical information.  I now have information at hand with regard to firms \\nthat will be recruiting at UT and OU this fall for summer intern positions.   \\nAnd based on this information, I believe that Enron is at risk for not hiring \\ntop students as interns for the summer of 2001 if we do not interview for \\nthese positions this fall.  \\n\\nWhile my research only touches on two of the schools at which Enron recruits, \\nI want to raise concern over this as a potential problem at many, if not all \\ncampuses that we have targeted for recruiting.    As administrators of the \\nprogram, you rely on the involvement of senior members of the company to \\ncarry the Enron message to campus.  I believe that we also have an obligation \\nto make this a two-way messaging system.  I strongly believe that we must \\naddress this potential risk for Enron extremely quickly, as teams will be on \\ncampuses across the country to conduct interviews in a matter of days.  I \\nsuspect that many Enron participants in the recruiting process are unaware of \\nthe Program's decision regarding the timing of interviews for summer \\ninternships.  In working with Rick Causey and Mike McConnell, executive \\nsponsors for UT and OU, respectively, they are as concerned as I about the \\ndecision on interviewing summer interns.  I have copied both of them on this \\nnote to the two of you. \\n\\nPlease let me know how this can be resolved.  With the help of James Scribner \\nand others, we have already compiled a list of students at UT and OU that \\nshould be targeted for summer internships.  I will offer as much of my time \\nas is feasible to work with staff members of the Program to devise creative \\nways to turn this around.  \\n\\n\",\n",

It will be flexible and powerful enough to support managers at\\nall levels and in all industries. This project is supported directly by the\\nHR Desktop Manager group and has been endorsed by top managers throughout\\nSAP in the U.S. and Germany.\\n\\nSAP has learned that to produce great software products we have to get close\\nto our end users. To do that, we need your help. Our goal is to visit eight\\nSAP customers in the U.S. Enron is one of the eight companies we would like\\nto visit.\\n\\nWho do we want to interview and observe?\\nIn a one-day visit, we want to observe and interview three types of\\nmanagers.\\n* High-level manager, involved in strategic planning, overall budget\\nresponsibilities, strategic direction. The high-level manager tends to\\ndelegate most of his daily and weekly activities to subordinates.\\n* Operational manager, involved in running a large department or small\\nsubsidiary. Often reports to the high-level manager. Has budget and\\npersonnel responsibility for the department or subsidiary. May also have\\nproduct-planning responsibilities.\\n* Group manager, primarily focused on a business activity such as\\naccounts payable manager, line manager, or production planner; but also\\ninvolved in managing a small group. Often has hands-on personnel and\\nlower-level budget responsibilities. Concerned with the day-to-day business.\\n\\nWhat can you expect during a site visit?\\nWe have found that the most efficient way to organize our interviews is to\\nmeet with a contact person in your company (that would be me) who will then \\nescort us to our\\ninterviews. This allows our team to introduce themselves and explain their\\nobjectives.  Our interviews are conducted at the managers' workstations\\nwhere our team will spend about 1/2 hour observing the manager in his/her\\ndaily work and asking questions.  We will then spend the next hour with \\nhis/her\\nadministrative assistant.\\n\\nInterviewees do not have to prepare anything. We prefer to interview people\\nwhere they work because often the work environment can give us a lot of\\ninsights about what managers need from a software product. We ask people to\\nbe completely honest and forthcoming with us. We treat all sensitive\\ninformation with utmost confidentiality.\\n\\nThere will be two teams from SAP meeting with a total of 6 managers and \\nadministrative assistants from \\nvarious areas in various business units.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\",\n",

We'll see in a few days if \\nthis helped on contributions.  \\n\\nText of e:mail message to Energy Operations employees:\\n\\nTwo weeks ago I toured the Depelchin Center, one of the organizations that \\nreceives much of its funding from the United Way.  I was surprised to find \\nout about the many programs that the center offers to neglected and abused  \\nHouston children and  the caring adults who will open their homes as foster \\nparents.  I had already completed my electronic pledge card before going to \\nthe center.  Learning about the important programs offered through Depelchin \\nand meeting four year-old Jessica and ten year-old Steven who were \\ntemporarily housed there before going to foster homes made me very glad to \\nhave made that pledge.  \\n\\nEnron has a terrific matching program that allows all employees to receive \\nmatching funds for dollars that you may choose to give to non-profit \\norganizations.  Hopefully, many of you take advantage of this to stretch your \\ncharitable giving during the year.  The United Way campaign is the one time \\neach year that Enron invites employees to partner with the company to make a \\ndifference in the lives of so many in Houston.  Each dollar pledged by an \\nemployee is matched by Enron.  \\n\\nIf you have not yet completed your electronic pledge, please consider doing \\nso as soon as possible.  Our United Way campaign draws to its conclusion next \\nWednesday, August 23.  I hope that each one of you will consider making a \\npledge.  There is no gift that is too small, because cumulatively all Enron \\nemployees can make a significant positive impact for Houston.

There are definitely some challenges we have to \\novercome to make the Hub idea within CommodityLogic.com as successful as \\nEnronOnLine rather than have it turn out like Sitara.\\n\\nI won\\'t repeat thoughts about how we split CL from Enron, but let\\'s put \\nourselves in the shoes of somebody external for whom this was presented as a \\npotential solution. Well, that\\'s an easy decision, somebody else is doing the \\nhard work, and not charging us very much for it. So sign-up, but don\\'t rely \\non anything until we see everything working.\\n\\nHandling counterparties not using the system\\nThe challenge here is that the Final Solution World with overybody using the \\nHub is wonderful, but until everybody is using the Hub, we have to keep other \\nprocedures and systems going, which stretches resources, Development, IT \\nSupport and user. This was why we decided to delay getting Bolero - the \\nconcept is wonderful, but the value to any user is very dependent on everyone \\nelse one trades with using the system. This is classic Chicken and Egg. Tom \\nhas a vision of CL providing the staff to handle this. This is taking us \\ncloser to an outsource-to-Andersen-consulting model which is certainly \\nachievable, although not quite such an easy sell.\\n\\nHow much resource is left\\nThe latest project always tends to attract the most imaginative people, who \\nare therefore not available for keeping everything else going and moving \\nonwards. How about if we accept that such resource is dedicated to CL, and \\nthen review what is left in the remaining environment. Does it mean we hold \\noff doing anything? If we do then increasing volume means that we might end \\nup incurring costs for massive numbers of people! We should go through \\ncosting for \"What happens if we completely stop development of X project?\". \\nIf that shows one would need 200 clerks for 3 years until something else \\ncomes along then it may be cheaper than developing, but I hope in most cases \\nit is not!\\n\\nStart small to prove concept\\nE.g. first application in April 2001 only covers 20 fields\\nThis is excellent, and we needn\\'t shout it too loud to investors in CL, but \\nfor our internal back office costing we need to acknowledge that it will be \\nyears before we can switch off many internal systems.\\nWe might limit the payback period on projects not part of this strategy to 3 \\nyears out?\\n\\nInclude European aspects from the beginning\\nThis really isn\\'t very difficult so long as one has some long-on-common-sense \\nEuropeans (not just Brits) involved in both specification and development \\nfrom the beginning, but an as example of how not to do it, look at EnPower \\nwhich took a year to allow just for currencies etc!\\n\\n80-20 rule for types of transaction\\nEOL has shown the benefits of focussing on simpler products first.\\nOnce we have robust warehouses for collecting accounting (DTL) and risk \\n(RisktRAC?) numbers then we can think about having vanilla products on STP, \\nand yet-to-become-vanilla products on explicitly different, manual \\napproaches. Until that time, we have a strong desire to include as many \\ndifferent prodcuts as possible for a given commodity in one system, which \\nmakes separating vanillas from others more complicated and costly (Think of \\ncertain deals in Power99 which are approximations of the actual deals, and \\nmanually tweaked every so often)\\n\\nTesting\\nTom\\'s first thought is that we could leverage initial users (who would not \\npay) to do much of the testing.\\nEOL clearly got its testing done, but other experience shows that in order to \\nhave anything which saves time one really does need to do all the different \\nphases - component, system, integration, end-to-end, and then user-acceptance.\\nEOL saw confidentiality as an issue and was therefore unable to use many \\nexternal users early in the process. It did have massive \\nresource-commandability and so obtained input from many traders. Do the \\nSupport functions have sufficient slack that they will be able to provide the \\nsame sort of user attention? Given how often I hear \"short people\", that \\nstrikes me as something which in London would require significant additional \\nresource, even after MG is absorbed.\\n\\nWhat else did you come up with?\\nRichard\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Our meeting is set with Mark Frevert, Rick Buy, you and me on \\nAugust 28 -- two weeks from next Monday, dictated by Rick Buy's schedule.  I \\nam concerned that waiting that long to get with Mark to discuss the potential \\nformalization of a global risk management operations role will put us behind \\nthe curve.  \\n\\nMike McConnell and Jeff Shankman plan to release a memo tomorrow on the \\nstructure of the Global Markets team, which will include a discussion on \\nBrent's role and reporting responsibilities.  Brent and Scott Earnest are \\nflying to London next Monday evening to spend the remainder of the week in \\nthat office to iron out details on supporting the global markets businesses.  \\nMany of their discussions will be with Mike Jordan and some logical points \\nwill be raised around co-ordination between EEL and EGM.  In a conversation \\nwith Gary Hickerson on Tuesday regarding his business, he stated that he \\nwanted to be sure that I had responsibility over London operations, as he \\nwill have support personnel in London and wants to be certain that efforts \\nare coordinated.  Separately, Jeff Shankman said that he was certainly \\ncomfortable with Brent in the Operations/CAO role but that he wanted Brent to \\nreport to me to ensure consistency, access to support resources and logic \\naround systems issues that cut across the ocean.  I told him that you and I \\nhad had discussions about a more formalized role to encompass responsibility \\nfor London and that we had a meeting planned with Mark Frevert on August 28.  \\nThat's a lifetime to a trader, and Jeff said he hoped that we could nail that \\ndown before the end of the month.  \\n\\nWhat are your thoughts about an earlier meeting with Mark Frevert?  The \\nsummary of doorstep findings can be finalized early next week.  I have \\nchecked Mark's travel schedule.  He will be in the Houston office next week, \\nwith Thursday, August 17 as the best day to potentially schedule a meeting.  \\n\\nI am not trying to rush this process, yet I know that by the end of August \\nmuch will have been decided around coordinating between ENA, EGM and EEL \\noperations.

Stephen was playing a critical role in ENA to insure a smooth \\ntransition for SAP, and Todd Lindholm at EBS was in agreement that Stephen \\nwould remain an ENA employee through implementation, with his performance \\nreview being based on his work for ENA.  Stephen is very talented and will no \\ndoubt do a great job at EBS.  During the first 6 months of 2000, however, his \\nheart was already at EBS and he failed to communicate with my other direct \\nreports on SAP issues, consistently missed my staff meetings, recruited our \\nother key SAP expert to EBS without a back-up plan for ENA, etc.  It was his \\nfailure to make his SAP assignment a priority that landed him in the Needs \\nImprovement category relative to other directors on my team.
