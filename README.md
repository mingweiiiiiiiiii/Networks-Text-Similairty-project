# Project Overview: Exploration of Textual Similarities in Network Communication

## Aim of the Project
This research project investigates the textual similarities and word patterns within network communications. It primarily utilizes the Enron email corpus and a dataset of scientific paper citations to explore linguistic convergence or divergence among individuals based on their communication interactions.

## Technologies Used
- **Python & NetworkX**: Utilized for graph construction and network analysis.
- **n-gram Vectorization**: Transforms text data into vector formats, facilitating textual similarity analysis.
- **Cosine Similarity Measures**: Quantifies the degree of similarity between text vectors.
- **Jaccard Index**: Measures the overlap in networks of communication and textual similarities.
- **Spacy**: Provides advanced semantic analysis tools to better understand text correlations.

## Project Workflow

### Data Preprocessing
- Cleaned and standardized data from emails and scientific papers using external resources.
- Removed non-essential information to focus solely on textual content.

### Graph Construction
- Created graphs representing communication interactions and others based on textual similarities using cosine similarity measures.

### Network Analysis
- Analyzed the constructed graphs to identify patterns, dynamics, and clusters within the textual content.

### Overlap Calculation
- Employed the Jaccard Index to determine the overlap between communication networks and networks of textual similarity.

## Results and Evaluation
- Results were interpreted to derive meaningful insights into textual similarities and their implications on network patterns.
